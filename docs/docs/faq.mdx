A collection of common questions and their answers.

### Is it possible to use an Angular component inside my translation string?
You can't do it using while AOT compilation, but there are 2 alternatives:
- Transform your component into a web component using `@angular/elements` and use the HTML tag in your translation.
- Separate your translation into 2 parts and insert the desired component between.


### Can I use HTML markings inside a translation?
Yes, you can! Pass the translated string in an `innerHTML` binding.

### I want to use the structural directive in my app, but isn't calling a function from the template a bad practice?
Using a structural directive is the recommended approach. Itâ€™s DRY and efficient, as it creates one subscription per template.

Moreover, the t function is `memoized`, It means that given the same key, it will return the result directly from the cache.

Furthermore, when using on push change detection strategy (which is recommended) the change detection cycles should greatly reduce.
